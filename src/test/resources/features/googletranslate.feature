Feature: Google translate
  As a web user
  I want to use google translate
  to translate words between different languages
  Scenario: Enter credentials
    Given since diego wants to enter his credentials
    When when he enters his email "riogo10@homail.com"
    And  your password "PruebasQA"
    Then it will validate the message "Enter your Email address and password correct"
